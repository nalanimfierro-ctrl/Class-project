#credit to chatgpt 
#credit to W3 schools

I used chatgpt on some of the harder parts for example I used it on the code to show what the correct answer was. I had to use multiple prompts to finally get what I wanted. 

I used the prompt "how do I make the correct answer contingent on if a certain mp3 file is playing and the correct matching drop down is selected"
I was given "<audio id="audio1" src="song1.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="playAudio()">Play Audio</button>

<select id="answerSelect">
  <option value="">--Choose an answer--</option>
  <option value="A">A</option>
  <option value="B">B</option>
  <option value="C">C</option>
</select>

<button onclick="checkAnswer()">Submit</button>

<p id="result"></p>"
which i initally used then i put my whole code back into chat to see where it was not working at to which I went back over and fixed my mistakes.

I also used W3 schools to do the simple things like create a drop down list and add buttons
I used previous code that I had in a previous project to generate the random song as well. Which I had initally got from Chat as well.

Of the things I need to include from my proposal below I was able to acomplish all of them besides the Future feature list
<h2>Feature List</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random song generator from audio hosted on computer</li> 
            <li>Drop down list of song choices</li> 
            <li>button that randomly selects song and plays it</li>
            <li>Timer that counts down</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Background changes either red or green based on if answer is correct</li>
            <li>Button that checks if answer is correct or not and shows "correct" or "incorrect"</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Future Feature list</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Potential integrate spotify or youtube songs to random generator</li>
        </ul>
