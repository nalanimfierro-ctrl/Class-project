I used chatgpt on some of the harder parts for example I used it on the code to show what the correct answer was. I had to use multiple prompts to finally get what I wanted. 

I used the prompt "how do I make the correct answer contingent on if a certain mp3 file is playing and the correct matching drop down is selected"
I was given "<audio id="audio1" src="song1.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="playAudio()">Play Audio</button>

<select id="answerSelect">
  <option value="">--Choose an answer--</option>
  <option value="A">A</option>
  <option value="B">B</option>
  <option value="C">C</option>
</select>

<button onclick="checkAnswer()">Submit</button>

<p id="result"></p>"
which i initally used then i put my whole code back into chat to see where it was not working at to which I went back over and fixed my mistakes.

I also used W3 schools to do the simple things like create a drop down list and add buttons
I used previous code that I had in a previous project to generate the random song as well. Which I had initally got from Chat as well.
